# Barely GL

This is a very simple wrapper I made whilst learning modern OpenGL and C++11. It is being used in a small graphics engine I'm writing called [BarelyEngine](https://github.com/adamransom/barely_engine), so you can see an example of its usage there.

_Currently only works on OS X, but I will be adding Windows support soon._
